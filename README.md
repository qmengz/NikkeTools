# List of tools:
- Catalog -> Decrypts all the dbs from AppData\\LocalRow
- MetadataDumper -> Dumps decrypted metadata from process memory
- Protobuf -> A tool to recover [protobuf](https://protobuf.dev/) definitions from the game assemblies, together with their HTTP paths
- StaticData -> Fetches AND decrypts the latest StaticData.zip (game data) from live servers
- UnLuac -> Decompiles Lua bytecode back to original code, modified for Nikke lua

## How to use them?
- Catalog | StaticData -> Just compile and run, works straight out of the box
- MetadataDumper -> Compile the project via Visual Studio 2022. Take theput the `NikkeMetadataDumper.dll` from `Win64` generated folder, together with the files in `Gadget` folder, and put them all in game directory next to `nikke.exe`. Run the game, a decrypted `global-metadata.dat` will be generated in the game directory.
- Protobuf -> Compile the project via Visual Studio 2022. Use the generated `global-metadata.dat` to dump Il2Cpp via 
[Il2CppDumper](https://github.com/Perfare/Il2CppDumper). Then either put the `DummyDll` folder next to the `NikkeProtoDumper.exe`, or drag the DummyDll folder into the `NikkeProtoDumper.exe`. `Nikke.proto` will be generated, in `proto3` format.
- UnLuac -> Run `compile.bat` to compile the project. Then put all the `.lua.bytes` files you got from [YarikStudio](https://github.com/yarik0chka/YarikStudio) or [AssetStudio](https://github.com/RazTools/Studio) into the `Lua` folder. Run the `DecompileAll.py` python script, and all the decompiled luas will be generated in `Decompiled` folder.
